                     <h2>Our History</h2><br>

                         <p>The Chinese Dragon Café (Pvt) Ltd is Sri Lanka’s oldest and most respected restaurant chain. Started in 1942 by a family of Chinese immigrants. Chinese Dragon Café (Pvt) Ltd has pioneered Chinese cuisine in Sri Lanka, offering authentic food refined specifically to suit the local palate. Authentic dishes such as our Foo Young Hai and our caramel pudding are still prepared just as they were when we first opened over half a century ago. Popular innovations have also become a trademark - our Hot Buttered Cuttlefish, Crab Claws, Hot and Spicy Seafood Soup (Tom Yum), Seafood Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, Chilli Paste and devilled dishes have become synonymous with Chinese food in Sri Lanka – often imitated but never replicated.</p><br><br>

                         <p> For a taste of the food that you have come to know and love, visit one of our branches or use our online ordering page to experience Sri Lanka’s premier delivery service and enjoy our dishes in the comfort of your own home.</p><br><br>

                         <p>The ambience of Chinese Dragon Café plays a primary role in attracting families, groups of friends, locals and foreigners to patronize its restaurants’ eager to sooth their taste buds with exceptional service provided by experienced and friendly staff.</p><br><br>

                         <p>To our loyal customers we thank you for your continued patronage and are thrilled that you are a part of the Chinese Dragon family.</p><br><br>
